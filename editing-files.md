title: Editing Files

Although there are several text based editors on our systems, the one that we will focus on will be a simple text editor called ***nano***.  To start nano, 
type the command:

```text
$ nano
```

You will be greeted by a screen that looks like:

![Nano](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/108911615/docimages/nano.png)

Type some words into the editor and when you would like to save the file press the ***control (ctrl)*** and the ***x*** keys a the the same time.  

You will be asked if you want to save the buffer (i.e. all of your changes)

```text
Save modified buffer (ANSWERING "No" WILL DESTROY CHANGES) ?                            
 Y Yes
 N No           ^C Cancel
```

If you want to save, press 'Y' otherwise press 'N'.  It will then ask you to type in the filename.  Call it 'hello.txt' and press enter

```text
File Name to Write: hello.txt                                                           
^G Get Help           ^T To Files           M-M Mac Format        M-P Prepend
^C Cancel             M-D DOS Format        M-A Append            M-B Backup File
```

*Note, that on the bottom of the screen, you will see ***^C*** right next to the word 'Cancel'.  When ever you see the ***^*** character, substitute it with the control key.  In otherwords, ***^G*** is ***CNTL + G*** and that key combination will bring up the help pages.*
