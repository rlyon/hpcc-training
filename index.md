# HPCC Tutorials


### Introduction

Our HPC systems are available to serve the computational need of the WSU researchers.  This means that WSU employees and students that are engaged in research may request accounts on the system.

The HPC user guide is designed to serve as an introduction to the WSU high performance computing systems and working in a Linux environment.  It covers several topics including connecting to the systems, navigating through the command line environment, writing shell scripts and submitting jobs to the cluster.  As new content is generated it will be posted in the guide.

### Inline help

Working in a command line environment may be new to many individuals.  The guide will only cover a small portion of this environment.  In certain tutorials, we will link to outside resources that are appropriate for the reader to continue learning.  In addition to the online resources, manuals for many of the commands covered in the tutorials and guides can be found on the systems themselves by using the ```man``` command.  As an example, to find out more information on the *copy* (```cp```) command you would type:

```
man cp
```

Use the UP/DOWN arrows on your keyboard to navigate the manual and when you are finished, just press the ```Q``` button.  If you are stumped, you can always contact us directly.
